# Security Checklist for Roshni Artwork Web

## Environment Variables Security
✅ **COMPLETED**: Updated MongoDB connection to use Atlas cluster
✅ **COMPLETED**: Added JWT_SECRET for future authentication features
✅ **COMPLETED**: Enhanced session secret requirements

## Immediate Security Actions Required

### 1. Generate Strong Secrets
Replace these placeholders in your `.env` file:
```bash
# Generate a strong session secret (at least 32 characters)
SESSION_SECRET=your-very-long-random-string-here-at-least-32-characters

# Generate a strong JWT secret
JWT_SECRET=another-very-long-random-string-for-jwt-tokens
```

### 2. Change Default Admin Credentials
Update these in your `.env` file:
```bash
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-secure-admin-email@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-very-strong-admin-password
```

### 3. MongoDB Atlas Security
- [ ] Whitelist your IP address in MongoDB Atlas
- [ ] Enable MongoDB Atlas authentication
- [ ] Consider using MongoDB Atlas VPC peering for production

## Application Security Features Already Implemented

✅ **Helmet.js**: HTTP security headers configured
✅ **Express Rate Limiting**: Contact form protected
✅ **Input Sanitization**: HTML sanitization for messages
✅ **Session Security**: MongoDB session store configured
✅ **File Upload Limits**: 10MB file size limit set
✅ **Error Handling**: Custom error pages implemented

## Additional Security Recommendations
